# Preliminary Audit: MAS Codebase

**Purpose:**
Establish a verified, clean foundation for future MAS development by ensuring the entire codebase conforms to the MAS Coding Standards and achieves near-100% test coverage. No fundamental redesign—focus is on clarity, reliability, and elite code reasoning.

---

## Audit Goals

- **Code Conformance:**
  - All code must adhere to `CODING_STANDARDS.md` (doc comments, error handling, idiomatic Go, etc.).
  - All exported types, functions, and packages must have Norwegian Scala-style doc comments.
  - All errors must be loud, context-rich, and actionable.

- **Testing:**
  - Achieve close to 100% test coverage on all existing functionality.
  - All business logic must be covered by meaningful unit and integration tests.
  - Favor table-driven tests and clear, descriptive test naming.
  - Tests must verify not just correctness, but also error handling and edge cases.

- **No Redesign:**
  - Do not fundamentally change or redesign existing product architecture.
  - Refactor only as needed to clarify, document, and test the code.

- **Documentation:**
  - All modules, functions, and types must be documented.
  - README and API docs must accurately reflect the current state of the codebase.

- **No Mysteries:**
  - All code paths and logic must be clear and auditable—no surprises or unexplained behaviors.

## Audit Tasks

1. **Code Review**
    - [ ] Review every package and file for adherence to coding standards.
    - [ ] Add/expand doc comments for all exported symbols.
    - [ ] Refactor for clarity, error handling, and idiomatic Go where needed.

2. **Testing**
    - [ ] Identify all untested or under-tested code paths.
    - [ ] Write or improve table-driven tests for all business logic.
    - [ ] Add tests for error conditions and edge cases.
    - [ ] Measure and report test coverage (target: ~100%).

3. **Error Handling**
    - [ ] Ensure all errors are context-rich, actionable, and never swallowed.
    - [ ] Wrap errors with `fmt.Errorf` and `%w` as appropriate.
    - [ ] Add error context (file, function, operation, inputs) everywhere.

4. **Documentation**
    - [ ] Ensure every package, type, and function is documented.
    - [ ] Update README and API docs to match audited codebase.

5. **Verification**
    - [ ] Run all tests and verify clean passes.
    - [ ] Confirm no unexplained behaviors or mysteries remain.
    - [ ] Summarize audit findings and next steps in this document.

## Deliverables
- Clean, well-documented, and fully tested codebase.
- Updated documentation and README.
- Audit summary and recommendations for next-phase work.
